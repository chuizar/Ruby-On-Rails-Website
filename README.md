# README
This is a class project that was used to create a simplified school banner that would create a student at MSU Denver with all necessary information using the Model-View_Controller(MVC) architecture. Created prefixes for classes, Courses that extended from prefixes, Sections within the courses and finally a semester to place these in. Further into the semester, we used faker to populate things as students, addresses, and phone numbers. There was also global navigation added to traverse the site and some css to clean the pages up. Validations were also added to help stop user errors such as limiting the user to only input numbers for their 900 numbers withing a certain range. This also includes protecting from things such as injections. Finally I created a simplified single page application(SPA) for the site.
